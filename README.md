# JDBC-MySQL-CRUD

## Project Description

This project demonstrates the implementation of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using JDBC with a MySQL database. The concepts covered in this project include JDBC, CRUD operations, Exception handling, the Collection framework, and the use of switch-cases for operation selection. 

## Features

- **Create**: Insert new records into the database.
- **Read**: Retrieve and display records from the database.
- **Update**: Modify existing records in the database.
- **Delete**: Remove records from the database.
- **Exception Handling**: Proper management of potential runtime exceptions.
- **Collection Framework**: Use of ArrayLists to manage data.
- **Switch-Case Statements**: Simplify the selection of CRUD operations.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: The programming language used for the application.
- **JDBC**: Java Database Connectivity for database interaction.
- **MySQL**: The relational database management system.
- **IntelliJ IDEA**: The integrated development environment used for coding.

## Setup and Installation
